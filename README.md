Outline of goals and draft of versions

End goal: A movie suggestion application that suggests movies on user data, or group collected data, that suggests movies through databases such as movielens and imdb, and directs users towards an appropriate streaming service.

Basic process milestone map
.01 - Movie suggestion through genres, ratings, actors/actresses, directors, producers, etc, through dictionary databases. Returns basic suggestions in terminal. Primarily building dictionaries.

.02 - Basic UI- Integrate a module that would allow a basic UI and for future customization that populates a list of movie suggestions based on filters associated with the dictionary.

.03 - Add in streaming webhooks and place buttons in the UI.

.04 - Allow user account creation, forming a database of user preferences based on a log-on that allows parametric filters to be saved and user preferences to better generate suggestions.

.05 - Allow in application ratings and create a "interested" button for group watching ease of use.

.06 - Quote finder! tried to find the quotes from movies

# Test Quote

I need someone to trace that call! But that's impossible! Not for me it isn't. Hackerman, he's the most powerful hacker of all time. Follow me. I was able to triangulate the cell phone signal and trace the caller. His name is REDACTED.
